# Selected Repository Summary

## Repository: [DevOps Pipeline by Kenichi](https://github.com/kenichi-07/devops-pipeline)

**Description**: 
[This is a study of a repository to know more about how deployment works]
This repository demonstrates the full lifecycle of a DevOps CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Flask web application to a Kubernetes cluster. The project emphasizes automation, scalability, and modularity, showcasing a complete integration of DevOps tools.

### Key Features:
- **CI/CD Automation**: Jenkins orchestrates the pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy code changes.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the Flask application, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform provisions AWS resources, while Ansible automates configurations.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes handles the deployment and scaling of containerized applications, supported by Helm charts.
- **Workflow**: Changes in the GitHub repository trigger Jenkins, which builds Docker images and deploys them to the Kubernetes cluster.

### **Technologies Used**:
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD  
- **Docker** for containerization  
- **Kubernetes** with Helm for orchestration  
- **Terraform** and **Ansible** for infrastructure provisioning and configuration  

### **Learning Outcomes**:
By exploring this repository, you'll gain insights into setting up a CI/CD pipeline, leveraging Docker and Kubernetes for containerized deployments, and automating infrastructure with IaC tools.
